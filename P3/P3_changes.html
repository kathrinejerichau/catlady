	        <h2>Changes to our time plan:</h2>
	        <p>
	        	The members of this group had other projects with deadlines which requied their attention. Therefore, some of the deadlines for this projects had to be postponed. Specific dates for these were not set, however. This affected the project workload, since many things were done at the same time, at the end of the project. Nevertheless, we managed to still finish the project in time for testing it before the delivery.
