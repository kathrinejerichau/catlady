		<section>
			Feedback Summary: A summary of the feedback you received organized by question type (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.
		</section>

		<section>
			Your Response: Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.
		</section>

		<section>
			Self-reflection: Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.

			Building structure is more demanding and time consuming than we thought. Postponed all oter deadlines<br>
			Group work is a team effort, not all members are as motivated as each other, hard if you don't ahve the same goals and work attitudes. <br>
			Communication is key, no one is studying the same program, two exchange students +  norwegian students <br>
			Working progress with planning the design, hard to know in the start when we didn't know whuch functions could be implemented in which languages. Navbar in javascript --> navbar in css <br>
			Everyone has diffeternt strengths and weeknesses, which can be both positive and negative thing. <br>
