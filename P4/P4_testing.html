		<h2>Testing Document</h2>
			<p>
			To test our website, we did a real life testing plus send out a survey via google forms. 
			</p>
		
		<h3>
			Google Form
		</h3>
		<p>
			To test the website we sent out this  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6n8l0qVWwfnuX0mMfvNkDXdi-pdy-EgbZnldWwCqIlS_0xg/viewform" target="_blank">survey</a>. <br>
			The survey collect data about the tester and devices. To make sure that the tester is going around the whole website,  they are asked to find special information on the site. 
			In the end the test person is asked about the navigation structure and the appearance of the whole website. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Real life testing
		</h3>
		 <p>
		 	We also did a real life testing. Here we had one testuser trying to find the same information as in the survey. We observed that the testuser quickly figured out the navigation between the different pages. though there was a problem when she tried to push the first "label" on the navigationbar, eg. the adopt, which does not have a link.

		<h2>Tester Audience</h2>
		<p>
			Eventhough we wanted to reach the intended users for the website, the people in the age from 50 and up, the survey was sent out to our acquaintances, who basicly is students. This means that the feedback we got might be a little of compared to the feedback we would get from the intended users.

		<h2>Self-reflection</h2>
			<p>
				When looking back on this project, our group can see that we have learned alot. First of all, building structure of a website (navbar etc.) is more demanding and time consuming than we thought. Since everything else is dependent on the structure, it is important to complete the structure early on in the project. Howerver, since there were quite alot of issues with the structure, all other dealines had to be postponed.
			</p>

			<p>
				We have also learned that a project like this demands team effort. Not all members are as motivated as others. This was a problem since not all members had the same goals and work attitudes for the project. This resulted in some uneven distribution of workload among the members of the group. Also, each member has a different set of strengths and weeknesses, which had both positive and negative effects on our project.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next important lesson we learned is that communication is key! Since none of the members of this group study the same program, it is difficult to arrange meetings. With two exchange students and three Norwegian students who study different fields, this was certainly an issue. However, in the end we managed to complete our requirements for the project.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also learned that planning the design is a working progress. It was difficult to know in the beginning which functions could be implemented in which languages. For example, the navbar was planned to implement in JavaScrit, but as the course progressed and our knowledge increased, we realized that the navbar could easily be created in HTML and CSS. Therefore, we had to change our plan of the design during the course of the project.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, we leaned that sometimes, when you're stuck on a problem, it is best to take a step back and try again later or the next day. Sometimes the brain just needs to get some rest and distance from the problem.
