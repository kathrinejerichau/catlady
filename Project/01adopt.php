        <p>
        It is easy to adopt one of my cats, check out the cats in our cats galleri or stop by the Cat Castle and find your match. 
	Once you’ve made a decision, we’ll sit down for an informal consultation to ensure that you and the pet you’ve selected are a good match. During this process I will also review the animal’s medical and behavioral records, explain policies and services available to adopters, and help you choose the right pet supplies.
	Once the papers are signed, you are ready to take home our new cat, and you and the cat can live happily ever after
