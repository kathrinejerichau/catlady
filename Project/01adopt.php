        <p> If you want to adopt a adopt a cat, this is how you do it: 
        	<ol type="1"> 
            	<li> Make sure that you are missing a cat in your life, that
					you have time for it. A cat needs a lot of attention.  </li>
                <li>Visit the shelter, talk to Cattius</li>
                <li>Look at and socialize with the cats </li>
                <li>Match with one (or more) of the cats </li>
				<li>Paperwork </li>
            </ol>
         </div>

        <p>
			It is easy to adopt one of my cats, check out the cats in our cats galleri 
			<a href="02ourCats.php">here</a> or stop by the Cat Castle and find your match. 
			Once you’ve made a decision, we’ll sit down for an informal consultation to 
			ensure that you and the pet you’ve selected are a good match. 
		</p>
		<p>
			During this process I will also review the animal’s medical and behavioral records, 
			explain policies and services available to adopters, and help you choose 
			the right pet supplies.
			Once the papers are signed, you are ready to take home our new cat, 
			and you and the cat can live happily ever after
