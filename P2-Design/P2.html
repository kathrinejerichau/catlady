		<section id="navigation">
	        <h2>5. Navigation Structure</h2>

	        <p>
				The navigation structure of Cattius' website can be described as mixed. 
				The navigation bar allows the user to  
				access all of the pages included in the webpage from any page of the website. 
				The navigation bar will always be 
				visable at the top of the page. In addition to this, 
				there will be a direct link between "Hand-in" to "Contact". 
				The reason for choosing the mixed structure is to give the user freedom to navigate easily through 
				the entire website. It also gives the user a clear view 
				of the general structure of the website. 
				So if the user is on one subpage they can easily access another subpage 
				within another page by using the navigation bar.
			</p>

		<section id="layout">
			<h2>6. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>

			<p>
				The universal design of the website is supposed to be simplistic and user friendly. 
				This is beacuse the users may have different 
				skills with computers and websites. Both young people, adults and elders should be able to use it. 
				For more details about the users, see "Specific Requirements".
			</p>

			<p>
				The website Cattius' Cat Castle should focus on accentuating the care that 
				the cats receive at the cat shelter. 
				It should be elegant, while still keeping it clean. 
				The feeling of the website is also cozy and warm, like a cat.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The specific styling for the website that will apply to all pages can be found below:

				<ul>
					<li><b>Font:</b> "Georgia" for the main title (<i>italic</i>, 
						36pt), navigation bar (18pt), and the body (13pt)</li>
					<li><b>Color Scheme:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Text: Black</li>
							<li>Background: pink-off-white #ffeddfff </li>
							<li>Links: #912F56</li>
							<li>Borders of the tabs: #4E3D42</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Body width:</b> 960px
						<ul>
							<li>Wrapper has a 20% total horizontal margin.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Links:</b> The main title “Cattius' Cat Castle” will 
						be a clickable link which will bring users back to the home page. 
						The menu sections will have drop-down menus that can be 
						clicked and contain links to the respective pages.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Navbar position and its appearance:</b> 
						The navbar will be included at the top of the page, below the main title. 
						When the mouse hovers over the tabs within the menu bar, 
						the drop-down lists will open, containing the main tabs' respective subpages. 
						When the mouse is on a certain tab, the background of 
						the link will turn to a lighter shade of its tab.
					</li>
					<li><b>Footer:</b> example@mail.com | Example address 1337</li>
					<li><b>Border Images:</b> We will use an open source flower image.</li>
				</ul>

	        <p>
	        	Information about the shelter will be found on the about-page. 
				Contact information such as address, email, 
				phone number and opening hours will be presented here along with the history of the cat-home. 
				A short biography of the owner Catius along with a short text about 
				her motivation for helping homeless cats can be found here.
	        </p>
			<p>
				We've chosen to go with a simplistic design, so the home page will contain some basic welcome text
				to the right, along with refer to the navbar for further navigation. Also a picture of cute kittens
				to the left.
			</p>
			<p>
				The banner will be 960x153px, and consist of one cat on each side, each 132px wide,
				and the center part will display the logo of "Cattius' Cat Castle".

			<img src="img/01homeWithDropDown.jpg" alt="Home with drop down lists">

	        <h4>Adopt</h4>
	        <p>Adopt will only provide a collapsible menu to reach the “How to adopt” and “Our cats” pages.</p>

		        This page will have information about how you can adopt a cat from the home. It will describe
				the complete process of adopting a cat. 
				The page will link a user to the JavaScript-form under "Contact", where the user
				can provide information about themselves, for Cattius to find an appropriate match,
				and perform background check to see if the user is suited to become a cat lover and owner.
			</p>
			<p>
				The right hand side will contain text, and the left hand side will contain graphical information,
				ending with an "Adopt" link, that sends the user to the contact form under "Contact".
	        </p>
			<img src="img/02adopt.jpg" alt="Adopt">

	        <h4>Our Cats</h4>
	        <p>
				Gallery of the cats currently at the Castle. Here you can browse the adoptable cats. 
				The purpose of this page is to motivate people to adopt the cats. 
			</p>
        	<p>
				The right hand side of the page will have textual information about the displayed cat, 
				with information such as characteristics of the cat along with how and
				why the cat ended up at the home. The left hand side will contain the rotating image gallery, 
				made in JavaScript. 
			</p>
			<img src="img/03ourCats.jpg" alt="Our Cats">
			
	        <h4>Hand In</h4>
	        <p>
				This page explains what to do if you have found a cat and want to hand it in to the shelter.
				There will be an appropriate image to the left, demonstrating a  hand-in. To the right,
				there will be a text informing users how to hand in a found cat, and the page
				ends up linking to the contact JavaScript form. 
			</p>
			<img src="img/04handIn.jpg" alt="Hand In">
			
	        <h4>Cat Care</h4>
	        <p>
				This page will explain the many different aspects of taking care of a cat. It
				is useful for a cat owner to know the things displayed on this page, in order to
				reach maximum caretaker potential. 
				To the left, we'll have a descriptive picture, and to the right, there will be 
				a JavaScript rotating tip box, with very useful information for new cat owners. 
			</p>
			<img src="img/05catcare.jpg" alt="Cat Care">

	        <h4>Entertainment</h4>
	        <p>
				The entertainment page is all about the memes. This will increase site traffic, 
				and popularity of the site. The page will be using a grid format, to allow
				the user the pick of the litter for increased entertainment value. The images will
				be clickable to maximize their size. 				
			</p>
			<img src="img/08entertainment.jpg" alt="Entertainment">
			
	        <h4>About</h4>
	        <p>

			</p>		
	        <h4>About Us</h4>
	        <p>
				The About page contains an image of the cat home to the left,
				and textual information about Cattius to the right. 
			</p>

	        <p>
				Here, the user can find all contact information to the cat shelter. 
				The left hand side of the page will contain contact information such as address,
				telephone, and opening hours. The right hand part of the page will have a JavaScript-form
				to contact Cattius, with the input boxes "Name", "Email", and "Message". At the bottom of
				the form, there will be a reset, and a send button. 
			</p>
			<img src="img/10contact.jpg" alt="Contact Cat Castle">
			
			<h4>Donate</h4>
			<p>
				If a user wishes to support Cattius, they can do so here. This is useful, as Cattius' welfare
				doesn't always go through, and donations help to pay for server costs, and cat food.
			</p>
			<p>
				The left part of the page will have various donation images linking to a payment method.
				The right part of the page will have textual information regarding donations, both 
				what the money goes to, and why it's useful for Cattius.

		    <h2>8. Specific Preferences</h2>

		    <p>Our client does not have many preferences when it comes to design of the webstie. </p>
		    <ul>
		        <li>Each page on the Web Site should load within 2 seconds. </li>
		        <li>Each page must have at least one picture of a cat.</li>
		        <li>The site should be easy to navigate, such that people of the ages 7-80, who have some computer knowledge, can use it.</li>
		        <li>It should be possible to update images and information about the cats in the home. (This will be done by a technical supprt 
				team if this function goes beyond the scope of this course.)</li>
		    </ul>

		<section id="hosting">
			<h2>9. Hosting</h2>

			<p>Our website will be hosted at <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/martkval/catcastle/">Martin's NTNU space</a><br>
			Ladius Crazius is still considering possible domains for the completed website.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="cccjavascript">
			<h2>10. JavaScript</h2>
				<h3>Navbar</h3>
				<p>
					The website will be using JavaScript for the navigation bar, to create a dynamic
					and convenient way of moving between pages. The navbar is going to have hover-over effects
					to display drop-down lists, which will provide new links. This simplifies the navigation process.
				</p>
				<h3>Contact Form</h3>
				<p>
					It is important that the users of the site can get in contact with Cattius easily, either
					if they wish to adopt a cat, or simply if they wish to congratulate her on her sick memes(entertainment).
					The contact form will be using JavaScript to send colloquial information to the Castle, by providing 
					the user with textboxes and buttons for resetting and sending the form. 
				</p>
				<h3>Rotating Image Gallery</h3>
				<p>
					In order to view and fully appreciate the inventory of cats, a rotating image gallery is needed.
					This way the user can see the big picture, and the importance of adopting cute cats, and decide
					which cat is best suites for their aesthetically needs. 
					JavaScript will be used to big-screen the pictures, and let the user click to go back and forth
					between pictures. 
				</p>
				<h3>Rotating Tip Boxes</h3>
				<p>
					If one is new to Cat Care, one might not know all about how to efficiently be a good parent.
					By using our rotating tip boxes, users can receive useful information in an appropriate and concise
					way. The JavaScript will make the boxes autorotate, and let the user pause, and skip between the boxes.
