Design guidelines: 
Your design document should describe what the finished
site will look like and how you will make it work.

This view of the design is that it
should be so clear, detailed, and complete that you could, in principle, mail it to a team abroad and
they could implement the website without further consulting you or the client. 


Mockups:
In this phase, focus on the layout of your pages: sizes, alignment, fonts, colors, borders, and so on.


Design Document:
1. Header - OK
2. Administrative details - OK
3. Purpose, goals, audience - split in 2, but OK(?)
4. Navigation Structure (explain why structure makes sense) - No map, no mention of linear
	vs hierarchical, or mixed structure, no site map(:o)
5. Page Layout and Appearance - CopyPasta@top, banner, footer, social(media) icons bar.
6. Content of the Website - text description(page goals) too vague, 
	"design decisions specific to it contribute into fulfilling such goals",
	"describe the design decisions that are unique for any particular page"
7. Minimum Requirements (NOT THERE AT ALL) - four distinct JavaScript applications:
		a) navbar
		b) contact form
		c) image gallery
		d) rotating cat facts(?)
	"Clearly indicate how each of you will be fulfilling these minimum requirements"
		+ 	Please note that each of these items must be constructed entirely by you and not copied from
			external websites on the Web (though you can modify code from our class materials). Once
			you fulfill the minimum requirements with your own code, you are allowed to get code from the
			web (with source attribution) to incorporate certain advanced components (e.g. image galleries
			with transitions), but they will not count as part of the minimum requirements.
8. Plan: Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site.
	Outline the tasks to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them.
	Include a list of files and folders, which will help each partner link files her partner has built. 
	Include a complete list of everything you need from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc), & when we expect to get them.

	The plan must cover all of the following: 
	-can be structured in table:
	(file name) (file description) (deadline) (assigned persons) 
		1. A complete list of all files you need to create, html, css, js, gif, jpg, etc
		2. Organizational scheme for the files (folder setup, etc, see picture on pdf2, page4)
		3. A person assigned to each file in the complete list, only one per item (except maybe css)
		4. Deadline for each file to be completed, to keep track if we're on schedule or not,
			leave time for betatesting. 
	


Create the design - 

"Also, remember that not every user will have precisely the same size screen you have, so think about
page layouts that are flexible and will still look okay in a variety of sizes. Document the decisions you
make.
Don't be afraid that by being specific in your design you won't be allowed to change your mind later.
You may change your mind during coding; you just have to document it in a changes.html document
that you'll submit along with your code. See the P2 Project Coding."
	aka: everything needs to be more precise. 


Submission: 	subfolder "images", not "img"
